# ML-Project
 
## CSCI3345 Machine Learning Final Project

We use three models and three datasets to create three TTS models. 

The first model uses a pre-trained BERT model and a custom dataset, which is the whole Bee Movie script read by a roommate for $20.
The second model uses a variational autoencoder and the LJSpeech dataset.
The third model uses transformers with a pretrained LSTM on the VCTK Speech dataset.

# Running Models
Each model can be ran by running it in google colab. Since we do not have access to GPUs on our computers, we did model training and development on google colab. For recording Nick's voice, a mac with custom recording software was also used.

# Contributions
Ike - Model 1 and custom dataset
Sam - Model 2 and LJSpeech dataset
Luke - Model 3 with VCTK Speech dataset
