## CSCI3345 Machine Learning Final Project

We use two models and two datasets to create a TTS model. The first model uses a pre-trained BERT model and a custom dataset, which is the whole Bee Movie script read by a roommate for $20. The second model uses a large CNN and a better Kaggle dataset


Improvements can be used by paying the roommate $20 again to read the Zoolander script, or by training the first model also on the Kaggle Dataset.


Results are clear enough to understand audio; however, there is robotic noise in the background of the first model trained on the roommate dataset. Further training on the Kaggle dataset may be able to reduce this, but this has not been done yet.
